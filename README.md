Objective:
To train a classifier that uses naive bayesian probability that can look at hundreds and hundreds of email messages or sms messages and detect which one is SPAM and which one is HAM(legitimate).

The file(dataset) contains one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.
